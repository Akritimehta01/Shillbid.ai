## 📌 Problem Statement

Online auction platforms are vulnerable to fraudulent bidding practices such as:

* Shill bidding
* Bid inflation
* Seller-bidder collusion
* Circular fraud rings
* Last-minute fake bid pressure

ShillBid AI aims to detect and analyze these behaviors using machine learning, anomaly detection, and graph-based fraud analysis.

## 📊 Core Modules

### 1. Fraud Detection Engine

Detects suspicious bidding behavior using:

* XGBoost
* Random Forest
* Logistic Regression
* Isolation Forest

### 2. Graph Fraud Analytics

Builds bidder-seller interaction networks to detect:

* Fraud rings
* Dense collusive clusters
* Repeated bidder patterns

### 3. Explainable AI

Provides interpretable fraud predictions using SHAP values.

### 4. Real-Time Alert System

Streams live bid events and triggers fraud alerts dynamically.
